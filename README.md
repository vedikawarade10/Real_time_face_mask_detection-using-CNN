# 🟢 Real-Time Face Mask Detection Using CNN

---

## 📄 Project Overview
This project detects whether a person is wearing a **face mask** in real-time using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
It is designed to work with a webcam and provides high accuracy for masked and unmasked faces.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a real-time face mask detection system.  
- Train a CNN model on a dataset of masked and unmasked faces.  
- Deploy the model for live detection using a webcam.  
- Ensure high accuracy and performance suitable for real-time applications.

## 🧠 Approach
1. **Data Collection:** Use a dataset of face images with and without masks.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Resize images, normalize pixel values, and augment data to improve model generalization.  
3. **Model Building:** Construct a CNN with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers for classification.  
4. **Training:** Train the CNN on the dataset and save the model (`.h5` file).  
5. **Real-Time Detection:** Load the trained model and detect masks in live webcam feed using OpenCV.

## ▶ How to Run

# 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# 2️⃣ Train the Model (Optional)

If you want to train the CNN model yourself:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

# 3️⃣ Run Real-Time Mask Detection

```bash
python real_time_mask_detection.py
```

# 🚀 Future Enhancements

Add detection for improper mask usage (mask worn incorrectly).

Extend to multiple faces in the frame simultaneously.

Convert model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.

Add notification system for workplaces or public spaces.
